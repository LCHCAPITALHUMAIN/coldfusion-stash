# The ColdFusion-Stash 

Who
---
You, if you are a ColdFusion developer or wish to become such.

What
----
Code, hopefully lots of it someday.  Modules, Components, Custom-Tags, and snippets to whet your stone and spice up your apps.  Pull requests welcome!!!  You can also just inform me of you favorite Gists or raise an issue and I'll splice things in.

When
----
Uh...this repo started after v10 was in the wild.  So, hopefully code is marked if it matters what version you're in.

Where
-----
GitHub.  And a ColdFusion site near you.

Why
---
Not everyone knows everything...and it's nice having all of this stuff in one place!

This is just another resource - factor in the popularity of GitHub and the convenience of pulling down the latest updates and it's a win.
